 <h2>About the Rabies Virus</h2>
 <p>A virus is an infectious agent that replicates itself in the host. A virus can only replicate itself in other living organisms.<br>
The Rabies virus was discovered by Italian physician Girolamo Fracastoro, in the 16th century. He called it "an incurable wound" as the fatal disease infected both humans and animals.Rabies causes inflammation in the host’s brain. Symptoms include fever and tingling at the site of exposure.
</p>

<h2>History of the Rabies Virus</h2>
<p>The Rabies virus have been around for quite a while. The first known writing about the virus comes from the Mesopotamian Codex of Eshnunna (circa 1930 B.C). The writing dictates that the owner of a dog that shows any signs of the rabies should be extra careful especially with bites. The owner would actually be fined if it's infected dog bit and killed another person. Rabies began in Boston in 1768, eventually spreading across other states. In France and Belgium, it wasn't uncommon for a person to be killed or commit suicide if bitten by a dog suspected of having rabies. In ancient times, people with the rabies infection had their tongue cut off due to the thought that the tongue was where rabies originate.  

<h2>Whom does it affect?/Transmission</h2>
<p>The People vulnerable to contract the diseases; living in areas with bats, traveling to developing countries, rural areas with wild life, frequent camping, and kids under 15 years as it is more common. The typical mode of transmision is through bite with an animal infected with the virus. Transmission from human-to-human is extrememly rare. There have been only a few recorded cases. Once the virus is in the human, it enters the peripheral nervous system, which is the nervous system outside the human brain and spinal cord. It then travels to the central nervous system, the system which controls the activities of the body. When in this phase, the virus cannot be detected within the host easily. When it reaches the host's brain, it causes encephalitis, the beginning of the symptoms. Once the host becomes symptomatic, treatments rarely are effective, with a 99% death rate. 
</p>

<h2>What treatments are available for the disease?</h2>
<p>There is no specific treatment for rabies. Although small number of  people have survived the infection, it is usually fatal without proper treatment.<br> There are treatments for people bitten with rabies.<br> Shots include a fast-acting shot [rabies immune globulin] and a series of vaccines to help your body fight the virus off. If it is a wound, thoroughly wash it with soap for about 5 minutes.

<h2>How Prevalent is it?</h2>

<p> As you can see, rabies cases have decreased as of recent years in the U.S, but if you live in Asia or Africa, it's a whole different story.<br>Rabies cause an estimated 26,000 deaths worldly each year. Most deaths occur in Africa and Asia. 90% of human rabies cases are caused by rabid dogs.<br> India has highest rate of human rabies in the world, due to the ammount of stray dogs. The number of human rabies cases has increased since a 2001 law forbade the killing of dogs.

<p>As you can see, not too long ago, Asia and Africa was given a high risk of catching the rabies virus. The U.S. had a low risk.

<h2>How Can You Prevent Rabies?</h2>
<p>About almost human cases were fatal before 1885. This was when French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur and French physician, bacteriologist, and immunologist,<br> Pierre Paul Emile Roux developed a vaccine. Their original vaccine was harvested from infected rabbits. This was from which the virus was dried up for 5-10 days, weakening it.<br> V-RG, a recombinant vaccine in Belgium, France, Germany, and the United States have been used to prevent outbreaks of rabies in undomesticated animals.<br> A recombinant vaccine is a type of vaccine created through recombinant DNA technology. Human deaths have dropped since vaccinations to domesticated dogs and cats as well as human vaccinations. Most deaths are caused by bite bites. These bites go unnoticed, which means no treament, resulting in death. Things you can do to prevent rabies are to get vaccinated and your dogs and cats vaccinated Symptoms of dogs rabies include; fever, seizures, paralysis, jaw is dropped, inability to swallow etc. Cats with symptoms of rabies include; agression, restlessness, loss of appetite, wekness etc.
