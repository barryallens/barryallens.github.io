 <h2>About the Rabies Virus</h2>
 <p>A virus is an infectious agent that replicates itself in the host. A virus can only replicate itself in other living organisms.<br>
When it is in the human body, it triggers an immune response that most of the times eliminates the virus.<br> Some viruses evade these responses and cause chronic infections. Rabies causes inflammation in the host’s brain. Symptoms include fever and tingling at the site of exposure.
</p>

<h2>Whom does it affect?</h2>
<p>Rabies is caused by a virus that affects the central nervous system. Domestic dogs and cats as well as wild animals, such as skunks and bats are able to transfer the virus to humans via bites and scratches.<br> People vulnerable to contract the diseases; living in areas with bats, traveling to developing countries, rural areas with wild life, frequent camping, and kids under 15 years as it is more common.
</p>

<h2>What treatments are available for the disease?</h2>
<p>There is no specific treatment for rabies. Although small number of  people have survived the infection, it is usually fatal without proper treatment.<br> There are treatments for people bitten with rabies.<br> Shots include a fast-acting shot [rabies immune globulin] and a series of vaccines to help your body fight the virus off. If it is a wound, thoroughly wash it with soap for about 5 minutes.
</p>

<h2>How Prevalent is it?</h2>

<p> As you can see, rabies cases have decreased as of recent years in the U.S, but if you live in Asia or Africa, it's a whole different story.<br>Rabies cause an estimated 26,000 deaths worldly each year. Most deaths occur in Africa and Asia. 90% of human rabies cases are caused by rabid dogs.<br> India has highest rate of human rabies in the world, due to the ammount of stray dogs. The number of human rabies cases has increased since a 2001 law forbade the killing of dogs.

<p>As you can see, not too long ago, Asia and Africa was given a high risk of catching the rabies virus. The U.S. had a low risk.

<h2>How Can You Prevent Rabies?</h2>
<p>About almost human cases were fatal before 1885. This was when French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur and French physician, bacteriologist, and immunologist,<br> Pierre Paul Emile Roux developed a vaccine. Their original vaccine was harvested from infected rabbits. This was from which the virus was dried up for 5-10 days, weakening it.<br> V-RG, a recombinant vaccine Belgium, France, Germany, and the United States to prevent outbreaks of rabies in undomesticated animals.<br> A recombinant vaccine is a type of vaccine created through recombinant DNA technology. This is involves putting DNA into an antigen, which causes an immune response in the bacterial cell, eliminating the antigen from the cells, then purifying it from them. You should vaccinate your dogs and cats. Maintain your pets exposure to wild life. You should report and treat ill pets.
